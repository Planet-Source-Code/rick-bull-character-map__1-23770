Character Map - Updated:
I wrote this quite a while ago and thought (for some reason) that I would upload it now. There are probably better ways to do things, but I am self taught so tough luck!

There are some options at the beginning of the code under the general section. These are constants that you can change which will affect the way the CMap works. I think that they are all commented, so read them and play about with them.

Oh yeah, you could place this form in your templates folder and it will appear in the Add Form window. That's what I did anyway..

If I nicked anyone's code I'm very sorry.

So long Suckers!

Updates:
1. Made a proper focus rect using the DrawFocusRect API rather than just a shape
2. Made a status bar from labels and picture box, so no need for Common Controls OCX
